Serves: 1
Ingredients
2 shots espresso, chilled (or 80ml strongly brewed coffee)
⅓ cup milk (80ml)
1 tablespoon granulated sugar (8.3g)
1 cup ice cubes, large
2 tablespoons chocolate syrup (30ml)
To serve: Whipped cream, Chocolate syrup
Instructions
In a blender, add 1 cup of ice cubes, and add ⅓ cup of chilled espresso. Today I used Nespresso Roma capsules but strongly brewed coffee works as well. Just make sure your coffee is chilled.
Add in ⅓ cup of milk (any milk you want: full-fat, low-fat, soy milk, etc), 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar, and 2 tablespoons of chocolate syrup.
Blend for about 30 seconds, or until smooth.
